# ðŸ’» Project Description 


Provided by technology providers authorised under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs, to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, the TLC Trip Record Data is an extensive dataset containing trip details of NYC cabs.

Dating all the way back to 2009, the dataset contains the trip records for each month which includes details such as the number of passengers in the cab, pickup and drop-off times and locations and fares. Initially the dataset only contained details for the classic NYC Yellow taxi cabs, but in 2013 trip records for Green cabs were also added. Additionally, For-Hire Vehicle trip records are included but will not be used for the purpose of this project.

The aim of this project will be to analyse the trip record data of Yellow and Green taxi cabs from January 2019 to April 2022 using Databricks Spark. The datasets are initially uploaded into a cloud storage platform (eg: Azure) and integrated into Databricks for further analysis using SparkSQL. PySpark will be used to build two ML models in order to predict the total amount column. The ML models will be tested for accuracy on a slice of the dataset.
